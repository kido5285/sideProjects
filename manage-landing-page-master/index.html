  Advanced built-in reports
  Set internal delivery estimates and track progress toward company 
  goals. Our customisable dashboard helps you build out the reports 
  you need to keep key stakeholders informed.

  Everything you need in one place
  Stop jumping from one service to another to communicate, store files, 
  track tasks and share documents. Manage offers an all-in-one team 
  productivity solution.
